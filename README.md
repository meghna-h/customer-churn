# Predicting Customer Churn

Subscription-based businesses employ possible strategies like acquiring more customers, upselling existing customers, or increaseing customer retention to generate more revenue. All these efforts come with a cost. If we could predict in advance which customers are at risk of leaving, we could reduce the customer retention costs by directing marketing efforts solely toward such customers and ultimately gain a better return on investment.
